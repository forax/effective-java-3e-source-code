The source code have been updated to use new constructs available since Java 9,
the version used by the 3rd edition.

In particular, the examples are using the constructs available in Java 14:
- `var`: [type inference of local variable](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286)
- `expression switch`: [exhaustive switch + more concise syntax](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361).
- `record`: [our bean killer](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359)
- `instanceof` with the [type test pattern](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/305)

I've also added some API calls, mostly List.of/List.copyOf (I think the later was added in 10).

Some edits may be surprising to you but I stand by them until you prove me wrong :)
